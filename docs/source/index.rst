QML: A Python Toolkit for Quantum Machine Learning
==================================================

QML is a Python2/3-compatible toolkit for representation learning of
properties of molecules and solids. QML is not a high-level framework
where you can do ``model.train()``, but supplies the building blocks to
carry out efficient and accurate machine learning on chemical compounds.
As such, the goal is to provide usable and efficient implementations of
concepts such as representations and kernels.

Code development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The QML code is developed through our GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/qmlcode/qml
------------------------------

Please add you code to QML by forking and making pull-requests to the "develop" branch.
Every now and then develop branch is pushed to the "master" branch and automatically deployed to PyPI, where the latest stable version is hosted.

See the "Installing QML" page for up-to-date installation instructions.
