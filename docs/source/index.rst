QML: A Python Toolkit for Quantum Machine Learning
==================================================

QML is a Python2/3-compatible toolkit for representation learning of
properties of molecules and solids. QML supplies the the building blocks to
carry out efficient and accurate machine learning on chemical compounds.
The goal is to provide usable and efficient implementations of
concepts such as representations and kernels as well as a high level interface
to make it easy for computational chemists to use these for machine-learning tasks.

Code development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The QML code is developed through our GitHub repository:

https://github.com/qmlcode/qml
------------------------------

Please add you code to QML by forking and making pull-requests to the "develop" branch.
Every now and then develop branch is pushed to the "master" branch and automatically deployed to PyPI, where the latest stable version is hosted.

See the "Installing QML" page for up-to-date installation instructions.
